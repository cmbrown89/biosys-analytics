                      Declaration of Independence

                   [Adopted in Congress 4 July 1776]



   The Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States of America

When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to 
dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to 
assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to 
which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent respect 
to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes 
which impel them to the separation.
